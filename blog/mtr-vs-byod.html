          <p class="article__lead">BYOD saves money upfront. MTR delivers consistency. But the real question isn't which is better - it's which is right for each room type in your estate. Here's a practical decision framework.</p>

          <h2>The Two Approaches</h2>

          <p>According to Frost & Sullivan, the most commonly used meeting room video solutions are Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) USB peripherals and all-in-one solutions like Microsoft Teams Rooms (MTR) systems. Both have their place, but they solve different problems.</p>

          <h3>BYOD: Bring Your Own Device</h3>

          <p>BYOD is exactly what it sounds like: employees bring their laptops to the meeting room, connect to the room's camera, microphone, and display, and run the meeting from their personal device. The laptop acts as the control hub.</p>

          <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Lower procurement costs (USB peripherals vs. dedicated compute)</li>
            <li>Flexibility across video platforms (Teams, Zoom, Webex, etc.)</li>
            <li>Users work with familiar device and interface</li>
            <li>Simpler initial deployment</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unsurprisingly, BYOD meeting rooms result in the most calls to the help desk</li>
            <li>BYOD meetings are most likely to start late as users sort out connection problems</li>
            <li>Inconsistent experience based on laptop model, driver versions, and user proficiency</li>
            <li>Security considerations with personal devices connecting to room equipment</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>MTR: Microsoft Teams Rooms</h3>

          <p>Microsoft Teams Rooms are purpose-built systems with dedicated compute, touch control panels, and optimised hardware-software integration. The room itself runs the meeting - users just walk in and join.</p>

          <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>One-touch join - meetings start on time with minimal setup</li>
            <li>Consistent user experience across all rooms</li>
            <li>IT teams spend less time troubleshooting</li>
            <li>AI-driven features: super resolution video, intelligent speaker tracking, transcription</li>
            <li>Native integration with Teams calendar and presence</li>
            <li>Microsoft's continuous updates ensure future-ready investment</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Higher upfront investment for dedicated hardware</li>
            <li>Additional installation and integration costs</li>
            <li>Teams-first (though can join other platforms via Direct Guest Join)</li>
            <li>Ongoing licensing costs (Teams Rooms Pro or Basic)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Hidden Costs of BYOD</h2>

          <p>The procurement savings of BYOD can be deceptive. The hidden costs quickly add up:</p>

          <h3>Time Lost to Troubleshooting</h3>

          <p>Every minute spent with highly paid professionals troubleshooting "can you see my screen?" or "I can't hear you" has a real cost. If research from Forrester is combined with meeting frequency and participant hourly wages, multiplied by eight minutes of saved time per meeting, that equals cost savings averaging <strong>€1,600 per week per room</strong> for MTR versus BYOD.</p>

          <h3>IT Support Burden</h3>

          <p>BYOD rooms generate significantly more support tickets than MTR rooms. Different laptop models, driver versions, operating system variations, and USB connection issues create an endless stream of variables to troubleshoot.</p>

          <h3>Delayed Meeting Starts</h3>

          <p>Time equals money. Having multiple employees sitting around waiting while someone figures out why the HDMI isn't working or the camera won't connect isn't just frustrating - it's expensive. Multiply across hundreds of meetings per week.</p>

          <h3>Inconsistent User Experience</h3>

          <p>In a BYOD environment, the meeting quality depends on the laptop brought into the room. An engineer with a well-maintained Surface gets great video. A salesperson with an aging ThinkPad and outdated drivers gets frustrated remote participants.</p>

          <h2>The Decision Framework</h2>

          <p>Rather than choosing one approach for your entire estate, match the solution to the room type and use case:</p>

          <table class="article__table">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Room Type</th>
                <th>Recommended</th>
                <th>Rationale</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Huddle spaces (2-4)</td>
                <td>BYOD or Entry-level MTR</td>
                <td>Lower utilisation justifies lower investment. Entry-level MTR under $1,000 now competitive.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Small rooms (4-8)</td>
                <td>MTR</td>
                <td>High utilisation, consistent experience matters, simple one-touch join adds real value.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Medium rooms (8-16)</td>
                <td>MTR</td>
                <td>More participants = more time wasted on technical issues. MTR ROI clear.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Large rooms (16+)</td>
                <td>MTR with enhanced AV</td>
                <td>High-stakes meetings require reliability. Multiple cameras, quality audio essential.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Boardrooms</td>
                <td>MTR with premium AV</td>
                <td>Executive visibility, client-facing. No tolerance for technical issues.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Multi-platform rooms</td>
                <td>Hybrid-capable bar</td>
                <td>Need to support Zoom, Webex, and Teams equally. Consider dual-mode devices.</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <h2>The Hybrid Approach</h2>

          <p>Customers often say: "We love Teams Rooms, but some of our spaces need something more budget-friendly." This is where hybrid-capable devices shine.</p>

          <p>Some modern BYOD bars can be retrofitted into MTRs. With a software upgrade and perhaps an additional compute unit, you can convert BYOD to MTR should needs change. You pick a device that brings both capabilities - a room system if you need it, but BYOD flexibility if you don't.</p>

          <p>Entry-level Teams Rooms, now priced competitively under $1,000 USD, are perfect for upgrading BYOD spaces. This allows a phased approach:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Deploy BYOD initially where budget is constrained</li>
            <li>Monitor utilisation and support ticket data</li>
            <li>Upgrade high-use spaces to MTR based on demonstrated need</li>
            <li>Maintain BYOD in low-utilisation spaces</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>The 2025-2026 Technology Landscape</h2>

          <p>Several trends are shifting the equation toward MTR:</p>

          <h3>AI Integration</h3>

          <p>Microsoft Copilot and AI-driven features are transforming meeting spaces. Transcription, summarisation, and speaker attribution keep users focused while capturing key decisions. These features are deeply integrated into MTR, less consistent in BYOD scenarios.</p>

          <h3>Meeting Equity</h3>

          <p>MTR systems support meeting equity so employees always have a good experience in hybrid meetings, regardless of whether they're in the room or joining remotely. Features like intelligent camera framing, voice isolation, and enhanced audio ensure remote participants aren't disadvantaged.</p>

          <h3>Management at Scale</h3>

          <p>MTR devices can be centrally managed through the Teams Admin Center, Microsoft Intune, or third-party monitoring platforms. BYOD rooms have no centralised management - you're managing hundreds of individual laptops that happen to walk into meeting rooms.</p>

          <h2>Making the Business Case</h2>

          <p>When presenting the MTR vs. BYOD decision to leadership:</p>

          <h3>For MTR Investment</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Calculate time saved per meeting (typically 5-10 minutes)</li>
            <li>Multiply by meeting frequency and average participant hourly cost</li>
            <li>Add IT support cost reduction (fewer tickets, faster resolution)</li>
            <li>Factor in user satisfaction and adoption benefits</li>
            <li>Compare against total MTR investment (hardware, installation, licensing)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>For BYOD Acceptance</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Identify low-utilisation spaces where ROI doesn't justify MTR</li>
            <li>Document platform flexibility requirements (multi-vendor environments)</li>
            <li>Plan upgrade path for when utilisation increases</li>
            <li>Accept the support overhead as a trade-off for lower capital cost</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

          <p>The transition from BYOD to native Teams Rooms isn't one-size-fits-all. While some organisations continue using BYOD for flexibility, the increasing demand for seamless, secure, and AI-driven collaboration is pushing many toward MTR solutions.</p>

          <p>The right answer is usually both: MTR for high-value, high-utilisation spaces; BYOD or entry-level MTR for the long tail of occasional-use spaces. Match the investment to the impact, and you'll build a meeting room estate that's both cost-effective and user-friendly.</p>
