          <p class="article__lead">What separates a smooth 200-room rollout from a political disaster? After delivering AV programs across resources, financial services, and education sectors, here are the patterns that determine success or failure.</p>

          <h2>The Stakes Are Higher Than They Appear</h2>

          <p>According to the Project Management Institute, nearly <strong>70% of IT projects fail, are late, or go over budget</strong>. Enterprise AV rollouts face all the same challenges as other IT projects, plus unique complications: physical installation, building constraints, integrator coordination, and highly visible outcomes.</p>

          <p>When a software project has issues, users might experience slow load times or missing features. When an AV project has issues, executives sit in boardrooms with broken video conferencing while important clients wait on the other end. The visibility of failure is acute.</p>

          <p>According to Enterprise Strategy Group research, nine out of ten organisations report their IT environments have become more complex over the past two years. This complexity multiplies exponentially in multi-site AV deployments.</p>

          <h2>The Five Failure Patterns</h2>

          <p>Over 11 years of enterprise AV delivery, I've seen the same failure patterns repeat:</p>

          <h3>1. Underestimating Site Variability</h3>

          <p>The pilot room worked perfectly. The first 10 rooms deployed smoothly. Then room 11 has different ceiling heights, room 15 has concrete walls that won't accept cable runs, and room 20 has acoustic properties that make the audio DSP settings completely wrong.</p>

          <p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Pre-deployment assessments at each location aren't optional. You need to map the existing technology landscape and physical constraints to identify site-specific challenges early.</p>

          <h3>2. Insufficient Standardisation</h3>

          <p>Without reliable templates, uniform workflows, and effective asset tracking, you can't monitor progress, limit setbacks, or replicate successes. Each room becomes a custom project, making support impossible and costs unpredictable.</p>

          <p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Develop room type standards (templates for small, medium, and large rooms) before deployment begins. Every deviation from standard creates future support burden.</p>

          <h3>3. Integration Complexity</h3>

          <p>The AV system works. The network works. The UC platform works. But somehow, when you put them together, the video freezes every 30 seconds because of a QoS policy conflict that no single team owns.</p>

          <p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Interoperability by design, not afterthought. Test the complete solution in real-world conditions before deployment, not in isolated lab environments.</p>

          <h3>4. Skill Gaps at Point of Delivery</h3>

          <p>Local teams may lack specialised expertise to configure and deploy advanced technologies, leading to implementation delays, quality issues, and potential security vulnerabilities. These skill gaps create inconsistent implementation quality and dependencies on centralised resources that delay rollouts.</p>

          <p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Develop standardised, detailed deployment playbooks that reduce the need for advanced technical skills at each location. Use remote deployment technologies that allow central teams to provide real-time guidance.</p>

          <h3>5. Concurrent System Changes</h3>

          <p>The classic case study is Hershey's ERP rollout that coincided with two other major business systems. As a result, they couldn't test each component carefully as needed, and the project became a well-documented disaster.</p>

          <p><strong>The lesson:</strong> AV rollouts don't happen in isolation. Coordinate with network refreshes, office relocations, UC migrations, and other infrastructure changes. The dependency map matters.</p>

          <h2>The Success Patterns</h2>

          <h3>Pattern 1: Ruthless Standardisation</h3>

          <p>Inconsistent AV systems are a silent drain on productivity, budgets, and user satisfaction. In organisations with multiple offices, campuses, or departments, the problem compounds fast.</p>

          <p>Successful rollouts define room types and stick to them:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Huddle spaces (2-4 people):</strong> Simple, consistent, minimal equipment</li>
            <li><strong>Small meeting rooms (4-8 people):</strong> Standard configuration, proven components</li>
            <li><strong>Medium rooms (8-16 people):</strong> Scalable audio, consistent control interface</li>
            <li><strong>Large rooms (16+ people):</strong> Engineered designs with acoustic treatment</li>
            <li><strong>Boardrooms/Executive spaces:</strong> Premium experience, higher touch</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Standardising reduces vendor sprawl, eliminates one-off configurations, and streamlines spare parts management - leading to more predictable budgeting and reduced total cost of ownership.</p>

          <h3>Pattern 2: Phased Rollout with Quality Gates</h3>

          <p>Success cannot be claimed unless it's measurable and it's measured. Clearly define and document success criteria while developing the business case, including measurement processes and metrics.</p>

          <p>Structure your rollout in phases:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Pilot phase (5-10 rooms):</strong> Validate design, refine playbooks, establish baseline metrics</li>
            <li><strong>Wave 1 (20-30 rooms):</strong> Test at scale with quality gates before proceeding</li>
            <li><strong>Wave 2-n:</strong> Full deployment with continuous improvement</li>
            <li><strong>Hypercare period:</strong> Enhanced support during initial adoption</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Each phase has defined quality gates. If issues exceed threshold, stop and fix before proceeding.</p>

          <h3>Pattern 3: Mock Runs and Rehearsals</h3>

          <p>The deployment plan should include sufficient time and resources for multiple mock runs, with all activities and dependencies documented and rehearsed.</p>

          <p>Before deploying to production rooms:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Complete a full installation rehearsal in a lab or staging environment</li>
            <li>Time each step of the installation process</li>
            <li>Identify dependencies and handoffs between teams</li>
            <li>Document exactly what tools, access, and resources are needed</li>
            <li>Validate rollback procedures (you'll need them eventually)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Pattern 4: Clear Accountability at Every Level</h3>

          <p>When multiple teams manage and operate technology systems, conflict arises between executive managers, in-house IT, and integrators when issues arise. The finger-pointing begins: "It's a network issue." "No, it's the AV configuration." "Actually, it's the UC platform."</p>

          <p>Define accountability clearly:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Program level:</strong> Who owns overall delivery and outcome?</li>
            <li><strong>Technical level:</strong> Who owns each system domain (AV, network, UC)?</li>
            <li><strong>Site level:</strong> Who is responsible for local coordination and access?</li>
            <li><strong>Support level:</strong> Who handles issues post-deployment?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Document escalation paths, response time expectations, and change windows before deployment begins.</p>

          <h3>Pattern 5: Documentation That Actually Gets Used</h3>

          <p>With consistent, standardised room designs, remote support teams can more easily troubleshoot and fix issues. But only if documentation exists and is accurate.</p>

          <p>Create documentation that serves operations:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Room records:</strong> What's installed, when, by whom, with what configuration</li>
            <li><strong>Network documentation:</strong> VLANs, IP addresses, QoS settings per room</li>
            <li><strong>Troubleshooting guides:</strong> Common issues and resolution steps</li>
            <li><strong>User guides:</strong> Simple, visual instructions for end users</li>
            <li><strong>Support handover:</strong> Everything L1 support needs to handle routine issues</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Critical Success Factor: Lifecycle Planning</h2>

          <p>The best enterprises approach AV at scale with a framework that includes not just deployment, but ongoing operations:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Firmware management:</strong> How will you handle updates across hundreds of devices?</li>
            <li><strong>Refresh cycles:</strong> When will equipment reach end-of-life, and what's the replacement plan?</li>
            <li><strong>Adoption strategies:</strong> How will you drive user adoption and measure success?</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> How will you collect feedback and iterate?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Technology uptime is critical. A proactive approach to maintenance includes preventive maintenance with regular checkups, 24/7 monitoring for device health visibility, and dedicated support contracts for expert assistance when needed.</p>

          <h2>The Pre-Deployment Checklist</h2>

          <p>Before you deploy the first room:</p>

          <div class="article__checklist">
            <ul>
              <li>Room type standards defined and approved</li>
              <li>Pre-deployment site assessments completed</li>
              <li>Network requirements documented and confirmed</li>
              <li>UC platform integration tested end-to-end</li>
              <li>Deployment playbooks created and rehearsed</li>
              <li>Quality gates and success criteria defined</li>
              <li>Support handover process documented</li>
              <li>Accountability matrix signed off</li>
              <li>Pilot phase plan approved</li>
              <li>Rollback procedures documented and tested</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

          <p>Enterprise AV rollouts fail for predictable reasons. The technology is rarely the problem. It's the coordination, standardisation, planning, and accountability that determine success.</p>

          <p>The difference between a program that enhances your reputation and one that damages it comes down to preparation. Do the hard work before deployment begins, and execution becomes straightforward. Skip the preparation, and you'll be doing it in production - with executives watching.</p>
