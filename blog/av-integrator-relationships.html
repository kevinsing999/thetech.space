          <p class="article__lead">The integrator blames your network team. Your network team blames the integrator. Meanwhile, the room doesn't work. Here's how to structure integrator relationships that deliver outcomes, not excuses.</p>

          <h2>The Pattern of Dysfunction</h2>

          <p>I've walked into this situation dozens of times. A new client engagement begins with the same story: "We have an AV integrator, but..."</p>

          <ul>
            <li>"...they install equipment but don't stick around to solve problems"</li>
            <li>"...every issue becomes a finger-pointing exercise"</li>
            <li>"...we can't get a straight answer about who's responsible"</li>
            <li>"...the rooms work in testing but fail in production"</li>
            <li>"...they're great at sales but disappear after commissioning"</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The common thread isn't that integrators are bad - most are technically capable. The problem is how the relationship is structured.</p>

          <h2>Why Integrator Relationships Fail</h2>

          <h3>1. Accountability Gaps</h3>

          <p>AV integrator service plans may not clearly define who's responsible for problems like downtime, repairs, and software updates. When multiple teams manage and operate technology systems, conflict arises between executive managers, in-house IT, and integrators when issues arise.</p>

          <p>The room has:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>AV equipment (integrator responsibility)</li>
            <li>Network connectivity (IT responsibility)</li>
            <li>UC platform (IT or separate team)</li>
            <li>Physical space (facilities responsibility)</li>
            <li>User experience (unclear)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>When a meeting fails, which team owns the problem? Without clear accountability, the answer is "not us" from everyone.</p>

          <h3>2. Transactional Relationships</h3>

          <p>Many integrator relationships are structured as transactions: you buy equipment, they install it, project closes. This creates misaligned incentives:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Integrator optimises for installation speed, not operational success</li>
            <li>No ownership of outcomes beyond commissioning sign-off</li>
            <li>Support becomes a cost centre, not a relationship builder</li>
            <li>Problems become warranty claims, not partnership opportunities</li>
          </ul>

          <p>As one industry expert notes: "An integrator shouldn't install and disappear. You need a partner who stays, measures results, and adapts as your business grows."</p>

          <h3>3. Unclear Success Criteria</h3>

          <p>What does "working" mean? If success isn't clearly defined, the integrator can claim success while users experience failure:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Integrator: "The equipment powers on and responds to commands"</li>
            <li>User: "I can't join my meeting because the display says 'no signal'"</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Both statements can be true simultaneously if success criteria weren't properly defined.</p>

          <h3>4. Communication Breakdowns</h3>

          <p>Lines of communication break down in predictable ways. Integrators are technically focused but may not communicate in enterprise-friendly terms. Issues get lost between technical teams and business stakeholders. Escalation paths are unclear or ineffective.</p>

          <p>When customer service representatives can't effectively manage concerns and complaints, relationships with customers suffer. The same applies to integrator relationships.</p>

          <h2>What Good Looks Like</h2>

          <p>Strong partnerships with AV integrators run on shared accountability. The difference between a trusted integrator and a forgettable one isn't perfection - it's ownership and accountability.</p>

          <h3>Clear Accountability</h3>

          <p>Working with a quality AV integrator translates to clear accountability, efficient problem resolution, and the ability to focus on your core business operations while the integrator handles technical complexity.</p>

          <p>Define and document:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Who owns the outcome:</strong> Not just the equipment, but the user experience</li>
            <li><strong>Who handles each issue type:</strong> Equipment, network, platform, integration</li>
            <li><strong>Response time expectations:</strong> By priority level and business impact</li>
            <li><strong>Escalation paths:</strong> When and how to escalate unresolved issues</li>
            <li><strong>Change windows:</strong> When maintenance can occur</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Outcome-Based Agreements</h3>

          <p>Move beyond equipment warranties to outcome agreements:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Availability targets:</strong> Percentage uptime for meeting rooms</li>
            <li><strong>Response commitments:</strong> Time to respond, time to resolve</li>
            <li><strong>User satisfaction:</strong> Feedback mechanisms and targets</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> Regular reviews and optimisation</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Support should never feel uncertain. You should know who owns an issue, expected response times, and when change windows occur.</p>

          <h3>Transparent Communication</h3>

          <p>Customers don't expect miracles. They expect honesty and solutions. An integrator who communicates "Here's what happened, here's how we'll fix it, and here's when you can expect it resolved" wins loyalty.</p>

          <p>Establish:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Regular status meetings:</strong> Weekly or fortnightly depending on activity</li>
            <li><strong>Issue tracking:</strong> Shared visibility into open items</li>
            <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Monthly performance against KPIs</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback loops:</strong> Mechanisms to surface user concerns</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Long-Term Partnership Mindset</h3>

          <p>Trust is the most valuable currency in any business relationship. In the AV world, it's the difference between a vendor and a partner. Customers don't just want someone to install equipment - they want a trusted partner who understands their environment, anticipates challenges, and stays engaged long after the ribbon-cutting.</p>

          <p>A strong AV partner offers a full suite of services - from initial consultation and system design to installation, training, and ongoing maintenance. This ensures consistency and accountability throughout the project lifecycle.</p>

          <h2>Structuring the Relationship for Success</h2>

          <h3>Before Engagement</h3>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Define outcomes:</strong> What does success look like for your organisation?</li>
            <li><strong>Document requirements:</strong> Technical, operational, and commercial</li>
            <li><strong>Assess capability:</strong> Can the integrator deliver at your scale?</li>
            <li><strong>Check references:</strong> Talk to existing clients, especially in similar environments</li>
            <li><strong>Align on governance:</strong> How will the relationship be managed?</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>During Contract Negotiation</h3>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Define scope clearly:</strong> What's included, what's excluded, what's an extra</li>
            <li><strong>Establish SLAs:</strong> Response times, resolution targets, availability commitments</li>
            <li><strong>Document handoff points:</strong> Where integrator responsibility ends and yours begins</li>
            <li><strong>Include escalation rights:</strong> What happens when SLAs are missed</li>
            <li><strong>Plan for change:</strong> How will scope changes be handled</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>During Delivery</h3>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Maintain oversight:</strong> Regular check-ins, not just milestone reviews</li>
            <li><strong>Test acceptance criteria:</strong> Verify outcomes, not just equipment function</li>
            <li><strong>Document everything:</strong> As-built drawings, configurations, access credentials</li>
            <li><strong>Train your team:</strong> Ensure operational handover is complete</li>
            <li><strong>Transition to support:</strong> Clear handoff from project to operations</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Ongoing Operations</h3>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Regular reviews:</strong> Monthly or quarterly performance discussions</li>
            <li><strong>Issue tracking:</strong> Shared visibility into problems and resolutions</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> Identify and address recurring issues</li>
            <li><strong>Relationship management:</strong> Maintain senior-level engagement</li>
            <li><strong>Contract reviews:</strong> Annual assessment of fit and performance</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>When to Add an Orchestration Layer</h2>

          <p>Sometimes the answer isn't replacing your integrator - it's adding oversight. An orchestration layer can:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Provide technical oversight across multiple vendors</li>
            <li>Ensure enterprise standards are met</li>
            <li>Coordinate between AV, network, and UC teams</li>
            <li>Manage escalations and issue resolution</li>
            <li>Handle documentation and knowledge management</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Your existing MSP and integrator relationships stay intact. The orchestration layer provides enterprise UC/AV expertise and coordination that ensures everyone pulls in the same direction.</p>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

          <p>Reliability isn't about never making mistakes - it's about proving you can recover from them. The same applies to integrator relationships. Problems will occur. What matters is how they're handled.</p>

          <p>Structure your integrator relationships for accountability, transparency, and outcomes. Define success clearly, document responsibilities explicitly, and maintain ongoing engagement. That's how you transform a vendor relationship into a genuine partnership.</p>
