          <p class="article__lead">Your CFO doesn't care about codec specifications. They care about risk, return, and strategic alignment. Here's how to frame your UC transformation in language that gets executive endorsement - not polite rejection.</p>

          <h2>Why UC Business Cases Fail</h2>

          <p>I've reviewed dozens of UC business cases over the years. The ones that get rejected share common patterns:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Technology-first framing:</strong> Leading with features, specifications, and vendor comparisons rather than business outcomes</li>
            <li><strong>Vague benefits:</strong> "Improved collaboration" and "increased productivity" without quantification</li>
            <li><strong>Missing risk analysis:</strong> No acknowledgment of what could go wrong or how it will be mitigated</li>
            <li><strong>Unrealistic timelines:</strong> Over-promising on delivery speed and underestimating complexity</li>
            <li><strong>Cost-only focus:</strong> Emphasising savings without addressing the investment required to achieve them</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The business cases that get funded do something different. They speak the language of the people who control budgets.</p>

          <h2>What Executives Actually Want to Know</h2>

          <p>When a CFO or CEO reviews a technology investment, they're asking specific questions. Every dollar allocated must be justified not just by capabilities, but by outcomes.</p>

          <h3>Question 1: What business problem does this solve?</h3>

          <p>Not "what technology does this deploy" - what <em>problem</em> does it solve? Executives think in terms of:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Revenue impact (can we win more business?)</li>
            <li>Cost reduction (can we spend less?)</li>
            <li>Risk mitigation (can we avoid bad outcomes?)</li>
            <li>Competitive positioning (can we operate better than competitors?)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If your business case doesn't clearly articulate which of these it addresses, it's already in trouble.</p>

          <h3>Question 2: What's the return and when do we see it?</h3>

          <p>The accepted timeframe for ROI is typically 12-18 months for UC investments. But executives want to see the full picture:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Total investment:</strong> Not just software licenses, but implementation, change management, training, and ongoing support</li>
            <li><strong>Payback period:</strong> When does the investment start generating positive returns?</li>
            <li><strong>Break-even point:</strong> When have the cumulative benefits exceeded the cumulative costs?</li>
            <li><strong>Ongoing value:</strong> What's the annual benefit once fully deployed?</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Question 3: What are the risks and how will you manage them?</h3>

          <p>Executives are inherently risk-conscious. A business case that pretends there are no risks isn't credible. Address:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Adoption risk:</strong> What if users don't embrace the new platform?</li>
            <li><strong>Integration risk:</strong> What if it doesn't work with existing systems?</li>
            <li><strong>Vendor risk:</strong> What happens if the vendor changes pricing or direction?</li>
            <li><strong>Delivery risk:</strong> What if the project runs late or over budget?</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Question 4: Why now?</h3>

          <p>Every investment competes with other priorities. You need to articulate the cost of delay:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>What opportunities are being missed?</li>
            <li>What costs are being incurred with the current approach?</li>
            <li>What risks are increasing while we wait?</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Building the Business Case: A Framework</h2>

          <h3>Step 1: Quantify the Current State Pain</h3>

          <p>Before you can show the value of the future state, you need to quantify the cost of today. Research shows that 86% of employees and executives point to poor communication as a primary cause of project failures, and 40% say it directly hampers daily productivity.</p>

          <p>For UC specifically, measure:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Time lost to technical issues:</strong> How many minutes per meeting are lost to connection problems, audio issues, or "can you see my screen?" Multiply by meeting frequency and hourly cost.</li>
            <li><strong>Travel costs:</strong> How much is spent on travel that could be replaced by effective video conferencing? UC can reduce travel costs by up to 25%.</li>
            <li><strong>Support costs:</strong> How much IT time is spent supporting aging or fragmented communication systems?</li>
            <li><strong>Opportunity cost:</strong> What decisions are delayed because the right people can't connect easily?</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step 2: Define Measurable Outcomes</h3>

          <p>"Cost per message" doesn't cut it in the boardroom. What moves the needle are outcomes:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Meeting efficiency:</strong> Meetings start on time, with one-touch join. Target: Reduce meeting start delays by X minutes per meeting.</li>
            <li><strong>Employee productivity:</strong> Industry reports indicate effective UC deployment can reclaim several hours per employee per week. Target: Reduce time lost to communication friction by X%.</li>
            <li><strong>Travel reduction:</strong> Target: Reduce domestic/international travel by X%, saving $Y annually.</li>
            <li><strong>Support ticket reduction:</strong> Target: Reduce UC-related support tickets by X%, saving Y hours of IT time annually.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step 3: Build the Financial Model</h3>

          <p>UC is a service, not a product, so conventional ROI metrics won't tell the whole story. For UCaaS, total cost of ownership is often a better metric than traditional ROI.</p>

          <p>Your financial model should include:</p>

          <h4>Investment Costs</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Platform licensing (per-user, per-month or annual)</li>
            <li>Hardware (meeting room devices, headsets, cameras)</li>
            <li>Implementation services (migration, configuration, integration)</li>
            <li>Change management and training</li>
            <li>Network upgrades (if required)</li>
            <li>Ongoing support and administration</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Benefit Streams</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Direct cost savings (legacy system retirement, travel reduction)</li>
            <li>Productivity gains (quantified as hours saved × loaded hourly cost)</li>
            <li>IT efficiency (reduced support burden, simplified administration)</li>
            <li>Risk reduction (improved security, compliance, business continuity)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Organizations generally can expect to save around 30% on UCaaS over alternatives, though savings vary depending on current infrastructure and needs.</p>

          <h3>Step 4: Prove It with a Pilot</h3>

          <p>If a pilot can't answer questions about outcomes, momentum fades fast. The most successful rollouts tie pilots to a single, visible business goal, prove the lift, then push for scale.</p>

          <p>Design your pilot to validate:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Technical viability (does it work in your environment?)</li>
            <li>User acceptance (will people actually use it?)</li>
            <li>Quantified benefits (can you measure the improvement?)</li>
            <li>Operational readiness (can IT support it at scale?)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>A 30-60 day pilot in a representative business unit provides the evidence you need for the full business case.</p>

          <h3>Step 5: Tailor for Your Audience</h3>

          <p>The best approach is to schedule information-gathering meetings with key stakeholders across the business. Different audiences need different framings:</p>

          <table class="article__table">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Audience</th>
                <th>Focus On</th>
                <th>Format</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>CEO/Board</td>
                <td>Strategic alignment, competitive positioning, risk</td>
                <td>One-page executive summary</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>CFO/Finance</td>
                <td>ROI, TCO, payback period, cost certainty</td>
                <td>Financial model with scenarios</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>CIO/IT</td>
                <td>Integration, security, supportability, architecture</td>
                <td>Technical assessment</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Business Units</td>
                <td>Productivity, user experience, workflow impact</td>
                <td>Use cases and demos</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <h2>The One-Page Executive Summary</h2>

          <p>For business owners or CEOs, focus on bottom-line impact: clear numbers showing cost reduction, faster response times, and short payback timelines. A one-page summary with a concise ROI table captures attention.</p>

          <p>Structure it as:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>The Problem (2-3 sentences):</strong> What business challenge are we solving?</li>
            <li><strong>The Solution (2-3 sentences):</strong> What are we proposing?</li>
            <li><strong>The Investment:</strong> Total cost over the business case period</li>
            <li><strong>The Return:</strong> Quantified benefits and payback period</li>
            <li><strong>The Risk:</strong> Key risks and mitigation approach</li>
            <li><strong>The Ask:</strong> What decision do you need?</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

          <h3>Mistake 1: Leading with Technology</h3>

          <p>No one outside IT cares that Teams has better PSTN integration than the current platform. They care that employees can join customer calls from anywhere without technical issues. Lead with outcomes, support with technology.</p>

          <h3>Mistake 2: Overpromising on Savings</h3>

          <p>If your business case shows 80% cost savings, you'll lose credibility. Even the most successful offshore outsourcing programmes (like United Technologies, an acknowledged leader) save just 20%, not the 50-80% often promised. Be realistic and you'll be trusted.</p>

          <h3>Mistake 3: Ignoring Change Management</h3>

          <p>The technology is often the easy part. User adoption is where most UC projects stumble. Your business case should include time and budget for change management, training, and ongoing adoption support.</p>

          <h3>Mistake 4: Treating It as a One-Time Event</h3>

          <p>A business case isn't just about getting funding - it's about setting expectations. If you promise benefits you can't deliver, you'll face hard questions at the next budget cycle. Build in realistic milestones and measurement points.</p>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

          <p>Good strategy gets funded. The business cases that succeed articulate value in terms executives understand: quantified benefits, managed risks, and credible delivery approaches.</p>

          <p>Your UC transformation may be technically elegant, but that doesn't matter if it never gets approved. Frame it as a business investment, prove it with a pilot, and present it with confidence. That's how initiatives get from proposal to production.</p>
